# Cricket Team Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This R project analyzes and classifies cricket team performance using logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM.  
**Key steps**:  
- Data preprocessing and EDA (ggplot2 visualizations).  
- Model training and evaluation (caret, rpart, e1071).  
- Achieved accuracy for   
  - Logistic Regression 
  - Decision Tree 
  - SVM 

## File Structure
- `scripts/`: Contains the R code for analysis.  
- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.  
- `outputs/`: Results (CSV files, plots).  

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.  
2. Run `scripts/cricket_analysis.R` in RStudio.
